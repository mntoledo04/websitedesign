<p>The evolution of the internet is inevitable. From its early days of personalized MySpace profiles and Geocities pages, to the mainstreamed, monetized world of Instagram and TikTok, change has always been a constant. But while companies and corporations have certainly shifted the internet away from its early creative chaos and towards a more profitable platform, that does not mean creativity within the internet itself is dead. As platforms evolve, so do the ways people find to express themselves within and beyond their constraints. The internet remains an infinite space, always adapting, where creative voices can still be heard.
<p>As the internet changes, so does the interface of websites and platforms. Wagner states that, “...this aesthetic detritus, its millennial pink, Memphis-esque shapes and squiggles made entirely for Instagram, became cold, devoid of joy and playfulness”. While it is true that platforms often get rid of vibrant aesthetics, users will continue to repurpose these tools in creative ways. When it comes to Instagram, I remember using the grid layout to create a larger image by arranging my posts. This way, when you visited my account, you'd see a big picture of a character from a show I was watching. You can change the cover image to your highlights, profile picture, and if you find a way, you can change the font of your captions and bio. Additionally, the rise of the “bougie design aesthetic” stripped vaporwave of its meaning and turned it into just another commercialized trend. Yet, users continue to find ways to innovate—whether through new meme cultures, absurd humor, or other platforms/spaces where people intentionally create chaotic and ugly designs as a way of rejecting mainstream aesthetics. These communities repurpose the internet’s limitations, proving that while corporations can shape digital spaces, they cannot fully control how people engage with them.</p>
<p>The author of the article points out that the internet has become very restrictive as well, but I think that there must be limits to what can be posted online. Not all content is beneficial, and certain restrictions are necessary to maintain a safe digital environment. The internet’s early days were marked by a lack of regulation, which led to both immense creative freedom and unchecked harmful content. Striking a balance between creative expression and responsible moderation is important, especially when people of younger ages can have access to it. However, as long as the internet exists, the ability to reshape it will too.</p>
<p>Even though I believe that we will find ways to be creative nonetheless, I do agree with the author that most websites and platforms on the internet are for some monetary gain. One of the more frustrating aspects of the modern internet is that creating personal websites is no longer as accessible as it once was. In the early days of the web, platforms like Geocities and Angelfire allowed anyone to build their own digital space for free. The loss of free website-building tools has undoubtedly restricted some aspects of digital creativity, making it harder for people to carve out their own unique spaces online. She writes that “apps, though they may be connected to the web, are not websites. As tech writer Christopher Mims noted in 2014, apps and app stores are all about throttling the competition”. These apps are also filled with ads, as companies focus on making money instead of giving users a creative experience.</p>
<p>While the internet has changed significantly from its early days, creativity has not disappeared, it has just adapted. Corporations may have commercialized many aspects of the online world, but people continue to find ways to express themselves. We still customize our social media profiles, create communities, create digital art and share memes.
